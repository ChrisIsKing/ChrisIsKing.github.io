I successfully defended my PhD thesis at the University of Michigan! Many thanks to my thesis committe members: Prof. Jason Mars, Prof. Lingjia Tang, Prof Wei Lu, Prof. Krisztian Flautner and Dr Mei Chen. I am grateful to my advisor Prof. Jason Mars for his guidance and support throughout my PhD journey. I am also thankful to my family, friends, and colleagues for their support and encouragement.
