Dr. Christopher Clarke is a Guyanese computer scientist, entrepreneur, and educator. He earned his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Michigan, specializing in Human-AI Interaction (HAI) and Natural Language Processing (NLP). He also holds a Master’s degree from the University of Michigan, a Bachelor’s degree from the University of Guyana, and a postgraduate degree in Entrepreneurship and Innovation from the University of Michigan.

He is one of the core contributors to the [Jaseci Project](https://github.com/Jaseci-Labs/jaseci), an open-source framework for scalable AI development, and the co-inventor of the open source Jivas Agentic Framework (**Coming Soon!**), which powers platforms like [TrueSelph](https://trueselph.com/), delivering state-of-the-art AI-driven personalization solutions.

Christopher’s work focuses on:

- **Foundation-Driven Research:** Designing cutting-edge algorithms and deep learning techniques to create robust and versatile AI systems. Examples of this include his work on papers such as [Rule By Example](https://aclanthology.org/2023.acl-long.22.pdf).
- **Interaction-Driven Innovation:** Developing intuitive, user-centered interfaces to enhance the accessibility and usability of AI-powered systems. Examples of this include his work on papers such as [One Agent to Rule Them All](https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.07665) and [MTLLM: LLMs are Meaning-Typed Code Constructs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08965).
- **Deployment-Driven Solutions:** Addressing practical challenges in deploying AI, with an emphasis on efficiency, robustness, fairness, and ethics. Examples of this include his work on [PEFT-U: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning for User Personalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18078) and [Jaseci](https://github.com/Jaseci-Labs/jaseci).

He has published research papers at renowned conferences and has collaborated with industry leaders such as Microsoft, Amazon, Ford, and Clinc Inc.

In addition to his technical achievements, Christopher is deeply committed to education and mentorship. He has served as a Graduate Student Instructor at the University of Michigan and is a lecturer at the University of Guyana, inspiring students to pursue impactful careers in computer science and AI research.

Outside academia, Christopher plays a pivotal role in Guyana’s technology ecosystem. He is as a director at both V75 Inc. and Nexus Hub Inc., where he focuses on the advancement of Guyana’s technology sector spearheading initiatives geared towards fostering collaboration, supporting innovation, youth development, and enabling economic stability for all of Guyana.

In his spare time, Christopher enjoys weightlifting, exploring new areas of knowledge, traveling, and hiking in warm climates.
